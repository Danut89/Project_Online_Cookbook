###  Design Choices

####  Colour Palette

| Colour Use        | Hex Code | Preview     |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| Primary Accent    | #FF7F50  | Coral       |
| Background        | #FFFFF2  | Soft Peach  |
| Card Background   | #FFFFFF  | White       |
| Text (Primary)    | #333333  | Charcoal    |
| Icon Accent       | #F4B400  | Amber       |
| Button Hover      | #FF5722  | Deep Orange |

These colours were selected to evoke **warmth**, **freshness**, and a **clean, appetizing** look appropriate for a recipe-sharing platform. They also provide high contrast and meet accessibility standards for readability.

####  Typography

DishCraft uses a modern serif/sans-serif pairing to balance elegance with readability:

- **Headings (h1–h4)**: `Playfair Display`, serif  
  - Stylish and expressive, giving the site a distinctive visual tone  
- **Body Text**: `Inter`, sans-serif  
  - Clean, modern, and highly legible for paragraphs and UI elements  
- **Fallback Fonts**: `serif` and `sans-serif` are defined for cross-browser compatibility  
- **Font Weights**:  
  - Headings: Bold (700)  
  - Body: Regular (400)  

This typography combination ensures strong visual hierarchy, clarity, and an appealing user experience across all devices.

####  Icons

DishCraft uses icons thoughtfully to enhance usability and provide visual cues without overwhelming the interface.

- **Source**: [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)  
- **Usage Areas**:
  - Navigation bar (e.g., profile, logout)
  - Category and recipe tags (e.g., 🍽️ Breakfast, 🧁 Dessert)
  - Buttons and CTAs (e.g., comment, like, view recipe)
  - Admin dashboard actions (e.g., edit, delete, user control)

Icons were chosen to:
- Improve scanability and recognition of key functions
- Provide context (e.g., a heart icon for likes, pencil for edit)
- Maintain a friendly, visual feel in both desktop and mobile views

####  Animations

DishCraft uses subtle animations and transitions to enhance interactivity and user engagement, without distracting from the content.

- **AOS (Animate on Scroll)**  
  - Used to fade in recipe cards and homepage elements as they enter the viewport  
  - Creates a smooth, polished browsing experience  

- **Hover Effects**  
  - Buttons and interactive icons scale slightly and change color on hover  
  - Enhances clarity of clickable areas  

- **Modals**  
  - Modal pop-ups are used for actions like deleting recipes or confirming sensitive operations  
  - Styled using Bootstrap and enhanced with soft transitions for accessibility and clarity  

- **Scroll Behavior**  
  - `scroll-behavior: smooth` applied site-wide for fluid navigation  

<details>

</details>

These animations provide instant visual feedback and elevate the perceived responsiveness of the application across both desktop and mobile devices.

---

####  Responsive Design

DishCraft was designed with a mobile-first approach and is fully responsive across all modern devices and screen sizes.

Key responsiveness features include:

- **Media Queries**: Custom breakpoints at `768px` and `576px` adapt layouts for tablets and mobile devices.
- **Fluid Layouts**: Content containers, buttons, cards, and forms adjust spacing and alignment dynamically.
- **Mobile Navigation**: The navbar collapses into a toggle menu on smaller screens for easier access.
- **Responsive Hero & Cards**: Homepage hero sections, category cards, and recipe previews all scale and rearrange for optimal usability.
- **Form Adaptability**: Search filters, form fields, and buttons adjust to full-width layouts on small screens.
- **Newsletter Section**: Stacks and centers all elements while retaining visual balance on mobile.
- **Touch-Friendly Elements**: Buttons and interactive areas include generous padding and clear hover/focus states.

These adaptations ensure a smooth and intuitive experience for both mobile and desktop users, making DishCraft a pleasure to use anywhere.


## Wireframes

To guide the layout and design of DishCraft, a series of wireframes were created for key pages. These wireframes helped establish user flow, component hierarchy, and responsive structure before development began.

Each screen was designed with mobile responsiveness and intuitive interaction in mind.

  - Comments, likes, and recipe badges

#### Update:
- Logged-in users can edit their own recipes from their profile or recipe page
- The form is pre-filled with current recipe data
- Changes are validated and saved back to the database

#### Delete:
- Only the recipe owner (or admin) can delete a recipe

### Image Upload via Cloudinary

DishCraft integrates **Cloudinary** to handle secure and scalable image hosting for recipe submissions.

#### How it Works:
- Users upload an image during recipe creation or editing
- Images are uploaded directly to a linked Cloudinary account via a secure POST request
- On success, the image URL is stored in the database and used throughout the app

#### Benefits:
- Offloads image storage from the backend server
- Automatically handles file compression, CDN delivery, and versioning
- Ensures fast image load times with responsive rendering

#### Upload Flow:
- Recipe form includes an image upload input
- Backend validates file type and integrates with Cloudinary’s API
- Image preview is displayed on the recipe detail page or card

#### Security:
- Image uploads are signed using environment-protected credentials
- Only authenticated users can upload images

### Category Filtering and Search

DishCraft allows users to efficiently search and filter recipes to discover dishes that suit their preferences, dietary needs, or available ingredients.

#### Search & Filter Features:
- **Search Bar**:
  - Users can search recipes by keyword (e.g., “pasta”, “vegan”, “chicken”)
  - Partial match support across titles, ingredients, and cuisine type
  - Case-insensitive

- **Filter by Category**:
  - Categories include: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert, Snack, Vegan, Vegetarian
  - Category filters are displayed in a grid with icons on the homepage
  - Clicking a category dynamically shows related recipes

- **Filter by Difficulty**:
  - Options: Easy, Medium, Hard
  - Helps users find recipes based on their skill level

- **Sort Options**:
  - Newest first
  - Most liked 
  - Alphabetical 

#### Responsive & Accessible:
- Dropdown filters collapse gracefully on mobile
- All filter controls are keyboard accessible
- Form uses semantic `<label>`s and `aria` attributes for usability

#### Backend Integration:
- Flask routes query the PostgreSQL database with dynamic filters
- Queries are constructed securely with SQLAlchemy

### LikeFavorite Recipes

DishCraft enables users to express appreciation for recipes by "liking" them — effectively adding them to their list of favorite dishes.

#### How it Works:
- Every recipe includes a **like (heart)** button
- Logged-in users can:
  - ❤️ Like a recipe (adds to their profile’s favorite list)
  - 💔 Unlike a recipe to remove it from favorites
- Likes are updated in real-time via form submission

#### Visual Feedback:
- Filled heart icon indicates a recipe is liked
- Count of total likes is displayed next to the icon
- Button uses subtle animation or color feedback on interaction

#### Data Model:
- Many-to-many relationship between users and recipes
- Likes are stored in a separate table (`likes`) with user and recipe foreign keys
- Prevents duplicate likes per user

#### Profile Integration:
- A user's profile includes a section displaying their liked recipes
- Encourages users to save favorites for later access

#### Permissions:
- Only authenticated users can like/unlike recipes
- Unauthenticated users are prompted to log in

### Comments

DishCraft allows authenticated users to leave comments on any recipe, encouraging discussion, feedback, and community interaction.

#### Core Features:
- Users can:
  - 💬 Add a new comment to any recipe
  - 🗑️ Delete their own comments
- Comments display:
  - Author name
  - Timestamp (e.g., “Posted 2 hours ago”)
  - Content in clean readable format

#### Form Behavior:
- Comment form is positioned beneath each recipe detail page
- Includes textarea input, submit button, and flash message feedback
- Validation ensures empty comments are not submitted

#### Moderation (Admin Role):
- Admin users can:
  - View and delete any comment for moderation
  - Access comments through the admin dashboard

#### Backend Handling:
- Comments are stored in a relational table linked to both:
  - The **user** who posted it
  - The **recipe** it belongs to
- Flask and SQLAlchemy handle form submission, validation, and storage

#### UX Considerations:
- New comments appear in real-time upon submission
- Each comment has a minimal, clean layout with user-friendly spacing

### Admin Dashboard

DishCraft includes a powerful admin interface that allows site administrators to manage users, recipes, comments, and maintain the platform’s content quality.

#### Access Control:

#### Design:
- Dashboard uses responsive tables and styled cards for data visibility
- Tooltips and icons clarify available actions
- Sortable or searchable tables improve admin workflow (optional enhancement)

#### Backend Logic:
- Role checking with conditionals (e.g., `current_user.is_admin`)
- All admin views query models using SQLAlchemy with pagination if needed
