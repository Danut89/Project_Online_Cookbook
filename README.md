###  Design Choices

####  Colour Palette

| Colour Use        | Hex Code | Preview     |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| Primary Accent    | #FF7F50  | Coral       |
| Background        | #FFFFF2  | Soft Peach  |
| Card Background   | #FFFFFF  | White       |
| Text (Primary)    | #333333  | Charcoal    |
| Icon Accent       | #F4B400  | Amber       |
| Button Hover      | #FF5722  | Deep Orange |

####  Typography

DishCraft uses a modern serif/sans-serif pairing to balance elegance with readability:

- **Headings (h1‚Äìh4)**: `Playfair Display`, serif  
  - Stylish and expressive, giving the site a distinctive visual tone  
- **Body Text**: `Inter`, sans-serif  
  - Clean, modern, and highly legible for paragraphs and UI elements  
- **Fallback Fonts**: `serif` and `sans-serif` are defined for cross-browser compatibility  
- **Font Weights**:  
  - Headings: Bold (700)  
  - Body: Regular (400)  

This typography combination ensures strong visual hierarchy, clarity, and an appealing user experience across all devices.

####  Icons

DishCraft uses icons thoughtfully to enhance usability and provide visual cues without overwhelming the interface.

- **Source**: [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)  
- **Usage Areas**:
  - Navigation bar (e.g., profile, logout)
  - Category and recipe tags (e.g., üçΩÔ∏è Breakfast, üßÅ Dessert)
  - Buttons and CTAs (e.g., comment, like, view recipe)
  - Admin dashboard actions (e.g., edit, delete, user control)

Icons were chosen to:
- Improve scanability and recognition of key functions
- Provide context (e.g., a heart icon for likes, pencil for edit)
- Maintain a friendly, visual feel in both desktop and mobile views

####  Animations

DishCraft uses subtle animations and transitions to enhance interactivity and user engagement, without distracting from the content.

- **AOS (Animate on Scroll)**  
  - Used to fade in recipe cards and homepage elements as they enter the viewport  
  - Creates a smooth, polished browsing experience  

- **Hover Effects**  
  - Buttons and interactive icons scale slightly and change color on hover  
  - Enhances clarity of clickable areas  

- **Modals**  
  - Modal pop-ups are used for actions like deleting recipes or confirming sensitive operations  
  - Styled using Bootstrap and enhanced with soft transitions for accessibility and clarity  

- **Scroll Behavior**  
  - `scroll-behavior: smooth` applied site-wide for fluid navigation

These animations provide instant visual feedback and elevate the perceived responsiveness of the application across both desktop and mobile devices.

---

####  Responsive Design

DishCraft was designed with a mobile-first approach and is fully responsive across all modern devices and screen sizes.

Key responsiveness features include:

- **Media Queries**: Custom breakpoints at `768px` and `576px` adapt layouts for tablets and mobile devices.
- **Fluid Layouts**: Content containers, buttons, cards, and forms adjust spacing and alignment dynamically.
- **Mobile Navigation**: The navbar collapses into a toggle menu on smaller screens for easier access.
- **Responsive Hero & Cards**: Homepage hero sections, category cards, and recipe previews all scale and rearrange for optimal usability.
- **Form Adaptability**: Search filters, form fields, and buttons adjust to full-width layouts on small screens.
- **Newsletter Section**: Stacks and centers all elements while retaining visual balance on mobile.
- **Touch-Friendly Elements**: Buttons and interactive areas include generous padding and clear hover/focus states.

These adaptations ensure a smooth and intuitive experience for both mobile and desktop users, making DishCraft a pleasure to use anywhere.


## Wireframes

To guide the layout and design of DishCraft, a series of wireframes were created for key pages. These wireframes helped establish user flow, component hierarchy, and responsive structure before development began.

Each screen was designed with mobile responsiveness and intuitive interaction in mind.

### Image Upload via Cloudinary

DishCraft integrates **Cloudinary** to handle secure and scalable image hosting for recipe submissions.

#### How it Works:
- Users upload an image during recipe creation or editing
- Images are uploaded directly to a linked Cloudinary account via a secure POST request
- On success, the image URL is stored in the database and used throughout the app

#### Benefits:
- Offloads image storage from the backend server
- Automatically handles file compression, CDN delivery, and versioning
- Ensures fast image load times with responsive rendering

#### Upload Flow:
- Recipe form includes an image upload input
- Backend validates file type and integrates with Cloudinary‚Äôs API
- Image preview is displayed on the recipe detail page or card

#### Security:
- Image uploads are signed using environment-protected credentials
- Only authenticated users can upload images
