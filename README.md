####  Typography

DishCraft uses a modern serif/sans-serif pairing to balance elegance with readability:

- **Headings (h1‚Äìh4)**: `Playfair Display`, serif  
  - Stylish and expressive, giving the site a distinctive visual tone  
- **Body Text**: `Inter`, sans-serif  
  - Clean, modern, and highly legible for paragraphs and UI elements  
- **Fallback Fonts**: `serif` and `sans-serif` are defined for cross-browser compatibility  
- **Font Weights**:  
  - Headings: Bold (700)  
  - Body: Regular (400)  

This typography combination ensures strong visual hierarchy, clarity, and an appealing user experience across all devices.

####  Icons

DishCraft uses icons thoughtfully to enhance usability and provide visual cues without overwhelming the interface.

- **Source**: [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)  
- **Usage Areas**:
  - Navigation bar (e.g., profile, logout)
  - Category and recipe tags (e.g., üçΩÔ∏è Breakfast, üßÅ Dessert)
  - Buttons and CTAs (e.g., comment, like, view recipe)
  - Admin dashboard actions (e.g., edit, delete, user control)

Icons were chosen to:
- Improve scanability and recognition of key functions
- Provide context (e.g., a heart icon for likes, pencil for edit)
- Maintain a friendly, visual feel in both desktop and mobile views

####  Animations

DishCraft uses subtle animations and transitions to enhance interactivity and user engagement, without distracting from the content.

- **AOS (Animate on Scroll)**  
  - Used to fade in recipe cards and homepage elements as they enter the viewport  
  - Creates a smooth, polished browsing experience  

- **Hover Effects**  
  - Buttons and interactive icons scale slightly and change color on hover  
  - Enhances clarity of clickable areas  

- **Modals**  
  - Modal pop-ups are used for actions like deleting recipes or confirming sensitive operations  
  - Styled using Bootstrap and enhanced with soft transitions for accessibility and clarity  

- **Scroll Behavior**  
  - `scroll-behavior: smooth` applied site-wide for fluid navigation
