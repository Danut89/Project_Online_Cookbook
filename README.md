##  About

**Project Name**: 🍽️ DishCraft  
**Developer**: Danut Grigore  
**Type**: Milestone 3 – Full Stack Web Development (Code Institute)

---

###  Project Overview

**DishCraft** is a full-stack, data-centric web application that allows users to create, discover, and manage recipes in a socially engaging environment. Built using **Flask**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Bootstrap**, the platform delivers a responsive and intuitive experience for users on any device.

Unlike traditional recipe websites that are often static or ad-heavy, DishCraft is designed to be **interactive, personal, and community-driven** — allowing users to contribute their own content, interact with others, and curate their favorite meals in one place.

Users can register, create and manage their own recipes, like and comment on other posts, and explore recipes filtered by category, cuisine, or difficulty level. Admins have elevated privileges to manage user content and keep the platform safe and respectful.

DishCraft aims to be more than a recipe site — it's a space where cooking becomes collaborative, fun, and accessible.

---

###  Site Purpose

DishCraft was created to solve a common gap in recipe-sharing platforms: the lack of meaningful **user engagement and ownership**. While many recipe apps offer thousands of professionally written recipes, few allow everyday home cooks to share, save, and interact with each other in a clean, distraction-free space.

This platform empowers users by giving them control over their culinary content and encourages interaction with a wider cooking community.

#### The app provides:

- 🧾 **Personal recipe management** – Add, edit, and organize your own creations  
- ❤️ **Social interaction** – Like and comment on recipes from other users  
- 🔍 **Smart discovery tools** – Search and filter recipes by category, difficulty, or cuisine  
- 🛠️ **Content moderation tools** – Admins maintain a safe, curated environment  

By focusing on simplicity, clarity, and community, DishCraft makes recipe sharing a rewarding, user-led experience — for everyone from beginners to passionate food lovers.

---

###  Target Audience

DishCraft is designed for:

- 🍳 **Home cooks** who want to organize and share their personal recipes
- 🧑‍🍳 **Hobby chefs** seeking feedback and inspiration from others
- 🆕 **Beginners** who need an easy-to-use platform with accessible content
- 🤝 **Social users** who enjoy liking, commenting, and discovering new dishes from peers

Whether you're saving your grandmother’s stew, sharing a TikTok-inspired dish, or browsing for quick weekday ideas, **DishCraft is your personal, social cooking companion.**

</details>

These animations provide instant visual feedback and elevate the perceived responsiveness of the application across both desktop and mobile devices.


####  Responsive Design

DishCraft was designed with a mobile-first approach and is fully responsive across all modern devices and screen sizes.

Key responsiveness features include:

- **Media Queries**: Custom breakpoints at `768px` and `576px` adapt layouts for tablets and mobile devices.
- **Fluid Layouts**: Content containers, buttons, cards, and forms adjust spacing and alignment dynamically.
- **Mobile Navigation**: The navbar collapses into a toggle menu on smaller screens for easier access.
- **Responsive Hero & Cards**: Homepage hero sections, category cards, and recipe previews all scale and rearrange for optimal usability.
- **Form Adaptability**: Search filters, form fields, and buttons adjust to full-width layouts on small screens.
- **Newsletter Section**: Stacks and centers all elements while retaining visual balance on mobile.
- **Touch-Friendly Elements**: Buttons and interactive areas include generous padding and clear hover/focus states.

<details>

### Image Upload via Cloudinary

DishCraft integrates **Cloudinary** to handle secure and scalable image hosting for recipe submissions.

#### How it Works:
- Users upload an image during recipe creation or editing
- Images are uploaded directly to a linked Cloudinary account via a secure POST request
- On success, the image URL is stored in the database and used throughout the app

#### Benefits:
- Offloads image storage from the backend server
- Automatically handles file compression, CDN delivery, and versioning
- Ensures fast image load times with responsive rendering

#### Upload Flow:
- Recipe form includes an image upload input
- Backend validates file type and integrates with Cloudinary’s API
- Image preview is displayed on the recipe detail page or card

#### Security:
- Image uploads are signed using environment-protected credentials
- Only authenticated users can upload images

![Search and Filters](/app/static/readme-screenshoots/filter-screenshoot.png)

</details>


### LikeFavorite Recipes

DishCraft enables users to express appreciation for recipes by "liking" them — effectively adding them to their list of favorite dishes.

#### How it Works:
- Every recipe includes a **like (heart)** button
- Logged-in users can:
  - ❤️ Like a recipe (adds to their profile’s favorite list)
  - 💔 Unlike a recipe to remove it from favorites
- Likes are updated in real-time via form submission

#### Visual Feedback:
- Filled heart icon indicates a recipe is liked
- Count of total likes is displayed next to the icon
- Button uses subtle animation or color feedback on interaction

#### Data Model:
- Many-to-many relationship between users and recipes
- Likes are stored in a separate table (`likes`) with user and recipe foreign keys
- Prevents duplicate likes per user

#### Profile Integration:
- A user's profile includes a section displaying their liked recipes
- Encourages users to save favorites for later access

#### Permissions:
- Only authenticated users can like/unlike recipes
- Unauthenticated users are prompted to log in

<details>
<summary>📸 Like Feature UI (Click to expand)</summary>

![Like Recipes](/app/static/readme-screenshoots/like-screenshoot.png)

</details>


### Comments

DishCraft allows authenticated users to leave comments on any recipe, encouraging discussion, feedback, and community interaction.

#### Core Features:
- Users can:
  - 💬 Add a new comment to any recipe
  - 🗑️ Delete their own comments
- Comments display:
  - Author name
  - Timestamp 
  - Content in clean readable format

#### Form Behavior:
- Comment form is positioned beneath each recipe detail page
- Includes textarea input, submit button, and flash message feedback
- Validation ensures empty comments are not submitted

#### Moderation (Admin Role):
- Admin users can:
  - View and delete any comment for moderation
  - Access comments through the admin dashboard

#### Backend Handling:
- Comments are stored in a relational table linked to both:
  - The **user** who posted it
  - The **recipe** it belongs to
- Flask and SQLAlchemy handle form submission, validation, and storage

#### UX Considerations:
- New comments appear in real-time upon submission
- Each comment has a minimal, clean layout with user-friendly spacing

## Database

### Schema Diagram

The database schema is designed to support users, their recipes, categories, comments, and likes.

<details>
<summary>📸 Click to view schema diagram</summary>

![Database Schema](/app/static/readme-screenshoots/database-schema-diagram.png)

</details>

### 🔍 Data Schema Explanation

The DishCraft database schema is designed around a **relational model** using **PostgreSQL** and SQLAlchemy ORM. It supports core functionality such as user management, recipe CRUD operations, user interactions (likes, comments), and administrative oversight.

#### 🔗 Key Entities and Relationships:

- **User**  
  - Central to the schema. Each user can own recipes, write comments, and like recipes.  
  - The `is_admin` boolean field allows role-based access control to moderate site content.

- **Recipe**  
  - Represents a single cooking recipe with fields such as title, image, category, cuisine, ingredients, difficulty, prep time, and instructions.  
  - Each recipe is owned by a user (via `user_id` foreign key) and can be liked or commented on by other users.

- **Category**  
  - Recipes can belong to one or multiple categories (e.g., “Vegan”, “Dessert”).  
  - A many-to-many relationship is implemented using the `RecipeCategory` association table, providing scalability for recipe filtering and search.

- **RecipeCategory (Join Table)**  
  - Links recipes and categories in a normalized, efficient structure.  
  - Prevents data duplication and supports multiple category filters per recipe.

- **Comment**  
  - Linked to both the recipe and the authoring user.  
  - This relationship ensures that only logged-in users can comment and supports admin moderation.  
  - Includes timestamp and content for discussion and feedback.

- **Like**  
  - Many-to-many relationship between users and recipes.  
  - Implemented as a standalone table with composite keys (`user_id`, `recipe_id`) to prevent duplicate likes.

#### 📐 Normalization and Integrity:

- The schema is **fully normalized**, reducing data redundancy and improving scalability.  
- All foreign key relationships enforce **referential integrity** and support **cascade delete** where appropriate.  
- Indexed fields (like `created_at`, `title`, and `user_id`) help optimize queries for filtering, sorting, and searching.

#### 🧩 Schema Support for Key Features:

| Feature                       | Schema Elements Involved                  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| User authentication          | `User` model + `is_admin` flag            |
| Recipe CRUD                  | `Recipe`, `User`, `Category`              |
| Likes/favorites              | `Like` (join table)                        |
| Comments                     | `Comment`, `User`, `Recipe`               |
| Admin moderation             | `User.is_admin`, relationships to all     |
| Recipe filtering/search      | `Category`, `RecipeCategory`, indexed fields |
| Profile views                | Linked `User → Recipe`, `User → Like`     |

This schema reflects **real-world content relationships** in a recipe-sharing application and has been thoroughly tested for data integrity, scalability, and performance.

##  Security Considerations

DishCraft was developed following best practices for secure web application development to protect user data, maintain platform integrity, and comply with Code Institute’s assessment standards.

### 🔑 Secrets & Environment Variables

- All sensitive information, such as:
  - `SECRET_KEY` (used for session security)
  - `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection string)
  - `CLOUDINARY_URL` (for image uploads)
- …are stored in an `.env` file and **never committed to GitHub**.  
- The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and variables are accessed via `os.getenv()` within the Flask app.

### 🔐 Password Security

- Passwords are **hashed using Flask-Bcrypt** before being stored in the database.
- Plain-text passwords are never stored or logged.
- During login, user input is securely compared against the hashed version using `check_password_hash`.

### 🧱 Authentication & Access Control

- **Flask-Login** handles session management and user authentication.
- Access to restricted routes is controlled using decorators like `@login_required`.
- Admin-only views and dashboard routes are protected using `current_user.is_admin` checks.

### 🛡️ CSRF Protection

- All forms are protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery using **Flask-WTF**.
- Each form includes a CSRF token to prevent malicious form submissions.

### 🧪 Session & Data Safety

- Flask sessions are securely signed using the `SECRET_KEY`.
- Sessions expire when the browser is closed or the user logs out.
- Validation is implemented for all forms using WTForms, providing both frontend and server-side protection against malformed inputs.

### 🚫 Debug Mode Off in Production

- Flask `DEBUG` mode is disabled in the live deployment.
- The `FLASK_ENV=production` setting ensures production safety and suppresses error messages.

---

**Summary**: All key security concerns including **password safety**, **form protection**, **session integrity**, and **admin access control** have been addressed. Sensitive data is safely managed using environment variables, and deployment configurations ensure no secrets are exposed.




##  Deployment

The DishCraft web application is deployed and hosted using **[Render](https://render.com/)**, which offers seamless support for Flask and PostgreSQL in a production environment.

🔗 **Live Link**: [DishCraft Live Site](https://project-online-cookbook.onrender.com)

---

### 🛠️ Technologies Used in Deployment

- **Render Web Service** – Hosts the Flask application.
- **Render PostgreSQL Instance** – Manages the live relational database.
- **GitHub** – Connected as the deployment source for automatic updates.

---

###  Deployment Steps to Render

To deploy the application from GitHub to Render, follow these steps:

1. **Push your project to GitHub**
   - Ensure that your latest code, requirements, and environment setup are committed and pushed to your GitHub repo.

2. **Create a new Web Service on Render**
   - Visit [https://dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)
   - Click **"New Web Service"**
   - Connect your **GitHub** account and select the repository containing your Flask project.

3. **Configure Deployment Settings**
   - **Environment**: Python 3.11+
   - **Build Command**:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - **Start Command**:  
     ```bash
     gunicorn app:app
     ```
     > Replace `app:app` if your entry file is named differently (e.g., `run.py:app`).

4. **Add Environment Variables**
   Go to the **Environment tab** in Render and add the following variables securely:

   | Variable Name      | Description                              |
   |--------------------|------------------------------------------|
   | `SECRET_KEY`       | Flask session encryption key             |
   | `DATABASE_URL`     | Render PostgreSQL connection string      |
   | `CLOUDINARY_URL`   | Your Cloudinary API string               |
   | `FLASK_ENV`        | Set to `production`                      |

5. **Database Setup**
   - If not already created, deploy a **PostgreSQL** service via Render
   - Use the provided `DATABASE_URL` as an env variable in your Web Service

6. **Automatic Deployment**
   - Once connected to GitHub, Render will auto-deploy every time you push to the main branch.

###  Post-Deployment Checklist

After deployment, ensure:

- ✅ All environment variables are properly configured
- ✅ No secrets (e.g., `.env`, credentials) are pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Application loads without 500 errors
- ✅ Admin and user routes behave securely
- ✅ Static files and images (e.g., via Cloudinary) load correctly
- ✅ Flask `DEBUG` mode is turned off

---

###  Cloning and Running Locally

To clone the repository and run the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dishcraft.git
cd dishcraft
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then create a .env file in the root directory with the following keys:
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=your-local-db-url
CLOUDINARY_URL=your-cloudinary-url
FLASK_ENV=development
```
Finally, run the app:
```bash
python run.py
```

##  Future Improvements

While DishCraft already provides a solid foundation for sharing and discovering recipes, there are several enhancements planned for future development:

- **Advanced Search & Filters**  
  Implement multi-tag filters, dietary filters (e.g., gluten-free, keto), and better ingredient-based search.

- **Recipe Rating System**  
  Allow users to rate recipes with a 1–5 star system to help surface the best content.

- **Recipe Collections**  
  Let users save and organize recipes into custom collections (e.g., “Meal Prep,” “Holiday Dishes”).

- **Private Recipes / Draft Mode**  
  Enable users to save recipes privately or work on drafts before publishing them.

- **Newsletter Integration**  
  Store emails and build functionality to send periodic recipe newsletters.

- **Accessibility Enhancements**  
  Improve color contrast and keyboard navigation to meet WCAG AA+ standards.

- **Dark Mode**  
  Provide a toggle to switch between light and dark themes for better user preference.

These improvements aim to elevate the user experience, expand engagement, and make DishCraft more dynamic and user-centric over time.
