##  About

**Project Name**: üçΩÔ∏è DishCraft  
**Developer**: Danut Grigore  
**Type**: Milestone 3 ‚Äì Full Stack Web Development (Code Institute)

---

###  Project Overview

**DishCraft** is a full-stack, data-centric web application that allows users to create, discover, and manage recipes in a socially engaging environment. Built using **Flask**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Bootstrap**, the platform delivers a responsive and intuitive experience for users on any device.

Unlike traditional recipe websites that are often static or ad-heavy, DishCraft is designed to be **interactive, personal, and community-driven** ‚Äî allowing users to contribute their own content, interact with others, and curate their favorite meals in one place.

Users can register, create and manage their own recipes, like and comment on other posts, and explore recipes filtered by category, cuisine, or difficulty level. Admins have elevated privileges to manage user content and keep the platform safe and respectful.

DishCraft aims to be more than a recipe site ‚Äî it's a space where cooking becomes collaborative, fun, and accessible.

---

###  Site Purpose

DishCraft was created to solve a common gap in recipe-sharing platforms: the lack of meaningful **user engagement and ownership**. While many recipe apps offer thousands of professionally written recipes, few allow everyday home cooks to share, save, and interact with each other in a clean, distraction-free space.

This platform empowers users by giving them control over their culinary content and encourages interaction with a wider cooking community.

#### The app provides:

- üßæ **Personal recipe management** ‚Äì Add, edit, and organize your own creations  
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Social interaction** ‚Äì Like and comment on recipes from other users  
- üîç **Smart discovery tools** ‚Äì Search and filter recipes by category, difficulty, or cuisine  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Content moderation tools** ‚Äì Admins maintain a safe, curated environment  

By focusing on simplicity, clarity, and community, DishCraft makes recipe sharing a rewarding, user-led experience ‚Äî for everyone from beginners to passionate food lovers.

---

###  Target Audience

DishCraft is designed for:

- üç≥ **Home cooks** who want to organize and share their personal recipes
- üßë‚Äçüç≥ **Hobby chefs** seeking feedback and inspiration from others
- üÜï **Beginners** who need an easy-to-use platform with accessible content
- ü§ù **Social users** who enjoy liking, commenting, and discovering new dishes from peers

Whether you're saving your grandmother‚Äôs stew, sharing a TikTok-inspired dish, or browsing for quick weekday ideas, **DishCraft is your personal, social cooking companion.**

<details>
<summary>üì∏ Click to view schema diagram</summary>

![Database Schema](/app/static/readme-screenshoots/database-schema-diagram.png)

</details>

### üîç Data Schema Explanation

The DishCraft database schema is designed around a **relational model** using **PostgreSQL** and SQLAlchemy ORM. It supports core functionality such as user management, recipe CRUD operations, user interactions (likes, comments), and administrative oversight.

#### üîó Key Entities and Relationships:

- **User**  
  - Central to the schema. Each user can own recipes, write comments, and like recipes.  
  - The `is_admin` boolean field allows role-based access control to moderate site content.

- **Recipe**  
  - Represents a single cooking recipe with fields such as title, image, category, cuisine, ingredients, difficulty, prep time, and instructions.  
  - Each recipe is owned by a user (via `user_id` foreign key) and can be liked or commented on by other users.

- **Category**  
  - Recipes can belong to one or multiple categories (e.g., ‚ÄúVegan‚Äù, ‚ÄúDessert‚Äù).  
  - A many-to-many relationship is implemented using the `RecipeCategory` association table, providing scalability for recipe filtering and search.

- **RecipeCategory (Join Table)**  
  - Links recipes and categories in a normalized, efficient structure.  
  - Prevents data duplication and supports multiple category filters per recipe.

- **Comment**  
  - Linked to both the recipe and the authoring user.  
  - This relationship ensures that only logged-in users can comment and supports admin moderation.  
  - Includes timestamp and content for discussion and feedback.

- **Like**  
  - Many-to-many relationship between users and recipes.  
  - Implemented as a standalone table with composite keys (`user_id`, `recipe_id`) to prevent duplicate likes.

#### üìê Normalization and Integrity:

- The schema is **fully normalized**, reducing data redundancy and improving scalability.  
- All foreign key relationships enforce **referential integrity** and support **cascade delete** where appropriate.  
- Indexed fields (like `created_at`, `title`, and `user_id`) help optimize queries for filtering, sorting, and searching.

#### üß© Schema Support for Key Features:

| Feature                       | Schema Elements Involved                  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| User authentication          | `User` model + `is_admin` flag            |
| Recipe CRUD                  | `Recipe`, `User`, `Category`              |

##  Security Considerations

DishCraft was developed following best practices for secure web application development to protect user data, maintain platform integrity, and comply with Code Institute‚Äôs assessment standards.

### üîë Secrets & Environment Variables

- All sensitive information, such as:
  - `SECRET_KEY` (used for session security)
  - `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection string)
  - `CLOUDINARY_URL` (for image uploads)
- ‚Ä¶are stored in an `.env` file and **never committed to GitHub**.  
- The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` and variables are accessed via `os.getenv()` within the Flask app.

### üîê Password Security

- Passwords are **hashed using Flask-Bcrypt** before being stored in the database.
- Plain-text passwords are never stored or logged.
- During login, user input is securely compared against the hashed version using `check_password_hash`.

### üß± Authentication & Access Control

- **Flask-Login** handles session management and user authentication.
- Access to restricted routes is controlled using decorators like `@login_required`.
- Admin-only views and dashboard routes are protected using `current_user.is_admin` checks.

### üõ°Ô∏è CSRF Protection

- All forms are protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery using **Flask-WTF**.
- Each form includes a CSRF token to prevent malicious form submissions.

### üß™ Session & Data Safety

- Flask sessions are securely signed using the `SECRET_KEY`.
- Sessions expire when the browser is closed or the user logs out.
- Validation is implemented for all forms using WTForms, providing both frontend and server-side protection against malformed inputs.

### üö´ Debug Mode Off in Production

- Flask `DEBUG` mode is disabled in the live deployment.
- The `FLASK_ENV=production` setting ensures production safety and suppresses error messages.

---

**Summary**: All key security concerns including **password safety**, **form protection**, **session integrity**, and **admin access control** have been addressed. Sensitive data is safely managed using environment variables, and deployment configurations ensure no secrets are exposed.




##  Deployment

The DishCraft web application is deployed and hosted using **[Render](https://render.com/)**, which offers seamless support for Flask and PostgreSQL in a production environment.

üîó **Live Link**: [DishCraft Live Site](https://project-online-cookbook.onrender.com)

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used in Deployment

- **Render Web Service** ‚Äì Hosts the Flask application.
- **Render PostgreSQL Instance** ‚Äì Manages the live relational database.
- **GitHub** ‚Äì Connected as the deployment source for automatic updates.

---

###  Deployment Steps to Render

To deploy the application from GitHub to Render, follow these steps:

1. **Push your project to GitHub**
   - Ensure that your latest code, requirements, and environment setup are committed and pushed to your GitHub repo.

2. **Create a new Web Service on Render**
   - Visit [https://dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)
   - Click **"New Web Service"**
   - Connect your **GitHub** account and select the repository containing your Flask project.

3. **Configure Deployment Settings**
   - **Environment**: Python 3.11+
   - **Build Command**:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - **Start Command**:  
     ```bash
     gunicorn app:app
     ```
     > Replace `app:app` if your entry file is named differently (e.g., `run.py:app`).

4. **Add Environment Variables**
   Go to the **Environment tab** in Render and add the following variables securely:

   | Variable Name      | Description                              |
   |--------------------|------------------------------------------|
   | `SECRET_KEY`       | Flask session encryption key             |
   | `DATABASE_URL`     | Render PostgreSQL connection string      |
   | `CLOUDINARY_URL`   | Your Cloudinary API string               |
   | `FLASK_ENV`        | Set to `production`                      |

5. **Database Setup**
   - If not already created, deploy a **PostgreSQL** service via Render
   - Use the provided `DATABASE_URL` as an env variable in your Web Service

6. **Automatic Deployment**
   - Once connected to GitHub, Render will auto-deploy every time you push to the main branch.

##  Future Improvements

While DishCraft already provides a solid foundation for sharing and discovering recipes, there are several enhancements planned for future development:

- **Advanced Search & Filters**  
  Implement multi-tag filters, dietary filters (e.g., gluten-free, keto), and better ingredient-based search.

- **Recipe Rating System**  
  Allow users to rate recipes with a 1‚Äì5 star system to help surface the best content.

- **Recipe Collections**  
  Let users save and organize recipes into custom collections (e.g., ‚ÄúMeal Prep,‚Äù ‚ÄúHoliday Dishes‚Äù).

- **Private Recipes / Draft Mode**  
  Enable users to save recipes privately or work on drafts before publishing them.

- **Newsletter Integration**  
  Store emails and build functionality to send periodic recipe newsletters.

- **Accessibility Enhancements**  
  Improve color contrast and keyboard navigation to meet WCAG AA+ standards.

- **Dark Mode**  
  Provide a toggle to switch between light and dark themes for better user preference.

These improvements aim to elevate the user experience, expand engagement, and make DishCraft more dynamic and user-centric over time.
