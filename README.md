</details>


####  Typography

DishCraft uses a modern serif/sans-serif pairing to balance elegance with readability:

- **Headings (h1‚Äìh4)**: `Playfair Display`, serif  
  - Stylish and expressive, giving the site a distinctive visual tone  
- **Body Text**: `Inter`, sans-serif  
  - Clean, modern, and highly legible for paragraphs and UI elements  
- **Fallback Fonts**: `serif` and `sans-serif` are defined for cross-browser compatibility  
- **Font Weights**:  
  - Headings: Bold (700)  
  - Body: Regular (400)  

This typography combination ensures strong visual hierarchy, clarity, and an appealing user experience across all devices.

- Provide context (e.g., a heart icon for likes, pencil for edit)
- Maintain a friendly, visual feel in both desktop and mobile views

<details>
<summary>üì∏ Example of Icon Usage (Click to expand)</summary>

![Icon Usage](/app/static/readme-screenshoots/icons-screenshoot.png)

</details>


####  Animations

DishCraft uses subtle animations and transitions to enhance interactivity and user engagement, without distracting from the content.

- **AOS (Animate on Scroll)**  
  - Used to fade in recipe cards and homepage elements as they enter the viewport  
  - Creates a smooth, polished browsing experience  

- **Hover Effects**  
  - Buttons and interactive icons scale slightly and change color on hover  
  - Enhances clarity of clickable areas  

- **Modals**  
  - Modal pop-ups are used for actions like deleting recipes or confirming sensitive operations  
  - Styled using Bootstrap and enhanced with soft transitions for accessibility and clarity  

- **Scroll Behavior**  
  - `scroll-behavior: smooth` applied site-wide for fluid navigation  

<details>
<summary>üì∏ Modal Animation Example (Click to expand)</summary>

![Delete Confirmation Modal](/app/static/readme-screenshoots/modal-screenshoot.png)

</details>

These animations provide instant visual feedback and elevate the perceived responsiveness of the application across both desktop and mobile devices.


####  Responsive Design

DishCraft was designed with a mobile-first approach and is fully responsive across all modern devices and screen sizes.

Key responsiveness features include:

- **Media Queries**: Custom breakpoints at `768px` and `576px` adapt layouts for tablets and mobile devices.
- **Fluid Layouts**: Content containers, buttons, cards, and forms adjust spacing and alignment dynamically.
- **Mobile Navigation**: The navbar collapses into a toggle menu on smaller screens for easier access.
- **Responsive Hero & Cards**: Homepage hero sections, category cards, and recipe previews all scale and rearrange for optimal usability.
- **Form Adaptability**: Search filters, form fields, and buttons adjust to full-width layouts on small screens.
- **Newsletter Section**: Stacks and centers all elements while retaining visual balance on mobile.
- **Touch-Friendly Elements**: Buttons and interactive areas include generous padding and clear hover/focus states.

<details>

### Image Upload via Cloudinary

DishCraft integrates **Cloudinary** to handle secure and scalable image hosting for recipe submissions.

#### How it Works:
- Users upload an image during recipe creation or editing
- Images are uploaded directly to a linked Cloudinary account via a secure POST request
- On success, the image URL is stored in the database and used throughout the app

#### Benefits:
- Offloads image storage from the backend server
- Automatically handles file compression, CDN delivery, and versioning
- Ensures fast image load times with responsive rendering

#### Upload Flow:
- Recipe form includes an image upload input
- Backend validates file type and integrates with Cloudinary‚Äôs API
- Image preview is displayed on the recipe detail page or card

#### Security:
- Image uploads are signed using environment-protected credentials
- Only authenticated users can upload images

<details>

</details>


### LikeFavorite Recipes

DishCraft enables users to express appreciation for recipes by "liking" them ‚Äî effectively adding them to their list of favorite dishes.

#### How it Works:
- Every recipe includes a **like (heart)** button
- Logged-in users can:
  - ‚ù§Ô∏è Like a recipe (adds to their profile‚Äôs favorite list)
  - üíî Unlike a recipe to remove it from favorites
- Likes are updated in real-time via form submission

#### Visual Feedback:
- Filled heart icon indicates a recipe is liked
- Count of total likes is displayed next to the icon
- Button uses subtle animation or color feedback on interaction

#### Data Model:

![Like Recipes](/app/static/readme-screenshoots/like-screenshoot.png)

</details>


### Comments

DishCraft allows authenticated users to leave comments on any recipe, encouraging discussion, feedback, and community interaction.

- Users can:
  - üí¨ Add a new comment to any recipe
  - üóëÔ∏è Delete their own comments
- Comments display:
  - Author name
  - Timestamp 
  - Content in clean readable format

#### Form Behavior:
- Comment form is positioned beneath each recipe detail page
- Includes textarea input, submit button, and flash message feedback
- Validation ensures empty comments are not submitted

#### Moderation (Admin Role):
- Admin users can:
  - View and delete any comment for moderation
  - Access comments through the admin dashboard

#### Backend Handling:
- Comments are stored in a relational table linked to both:
  - The **user** who posted it
  - The **recipe** it belongs to
- Flask and SQLAlchemy handle form submission, validation, and storage

#### UX Considerations:
- New comments appear in real-time upon submission
- Each comment has a minimal, clean layout with user-friendly spacing

### Accessibility

DishCraft was built with accessibility as a core consideration, ensuring the platform is inclusive and user-friendly for all visitors, including those using assistive technologies.

Key accessibility measures implemented:

- **Semantic HTML Structure**  
  All pages utilize semantic HTML5 elements such as `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, and `<section>` to enhance document structure and assistive tool readability.

- **Keyboard Navigability**  
  All interactive elements (e.g., navigation links, buttons, forms) are accessible via keyboard (Tab/Shift+Tab and Enter) with visible focus states for clarity.

- **Color Contrast Compliance**  
  The color scheme was selected with accessibility in mind, maintaining strong foreground/background contrast ratios to meet [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) standards.

- **Descriptive Alt Text**  
  All images include relevant `alt` attributes to provide visual context for screen reader users.

- **Accessible Forms**  
  All form fields include associated `<label>` tags, and use `aria-` attributes where needed for improved screen reader support.

- **Modal Accessibility**  
  Confirmation modals (e.g., delete recipe) are built using Bootstrap and enhanced with ARIA roles to ensure focus trapping and proper keyboard control.

- **Responsive Typography**  
  Font sizes and spacing are responsive and legible across all screen sizes without the need for zoom.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

While DishCraft already provides a solid foundation for sharing and discovering recipes, there are several enhancements planned for future development:

- **Advanced Search & Filters**  
  Implement multi-tag filters, dietary filters (e.g., gluten-free, keto), and better ingredient-based search.

- **Recipe Rating System**  
  Allow users to rate recipes with a 1‚Äì5 star system to help surface the best content.

- **Recipe Collections**  
  Let users save and organize recipes into custom collections (e.g., ‚ÄúMeal Prep,‚Äù ‚ÄúHoliday Dishes‚Äù).

- **Private Recipes / Draft Mode**  
  Enable users to save recipes privately or work on drafts before publishing them.

- **Newsletter Integration**  
  Store emails and build functionality to send periodic recipe newsletters.

- **Accessibility Enhancements**  
  Improve color contrast and keyboard navigation to meet WCAG AA+ standards.

- **Dark Mode**  
  Provide a toggle to switch between light and dark themes for better user preference.

These improvements aim to elevate the user experience, expand engagement, and make DishCraft more dynamic and user-centric over time.
